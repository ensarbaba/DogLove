# DogLove

Dog Love is a dog search by name app written in Swift using MVVM architecture. No third party libraries used in this app.

## Features
Search for dogs using search bar with The Dog API.

:exclamation: API sometimes gives recurring images with different URLs. Therefore, duplicate images may be seen but it's not the iOS application's error.  

## Nice to have 3rd party libraries:
- [ ] SDWebImage - A library provides an async image downloader with cache support.
- [ ] Bagel - Bagel is a little native iOS network debugger.
- [ ] SwiftLint - A tool to enforce Swift style and conventions.
- [ ] R.swift - Get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects.
